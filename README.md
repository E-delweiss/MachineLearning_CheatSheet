# Machine learning concepts that you might want to learn

### About this repository
This repository is about machine learning concepts that I learnt through the MOOC *"Machine learning in python with scikit-learn"* created by INRIA, and so Scikit-Learn's programers.
The background is all about "how to use the Scikit-Learn library" but the foreground of this MOOC is to be critical about each step of the design of a predictive modeling pipeline: from choices in data preprocessing, to choosing models, gaining insights on their failure modes and interpreting their predictions. \
Hence, this repository gives a solid basis to initiate more complex insights of Machine Learning and also, it gives a general overview of the Scikit-Learn API.

### Content
This repository contains two different files : 
- `MachineLearning_SumUp` : it focuses on general machine learning notions and tries to get rid of all the Scikit-Learn notions as possible.
- `Scikit-Learn_API` : it focuses on the Scikit-Learn API, so it is more a "how to use" file regarding the concepts established in the MachineLearning_SumUp file.


### About the file format
Machine learning contains a lot of notions whose overlaps with each others. So to clarify all of them, I found the *mindnode* format really helpful to get an overview of all the features to understand and get the link between them. \
I'm aware that everybody doesn't have the MindNode app so this repository contains various file formats : 
* `.mindnode` for MindNode app
* `.mm` for FreeMind app
* `.pdf`


### Sources
All the code that you will find in those file are taken from the MOOC "Machine learning in python with scikit-learn" by INRIA.
Also, all the machine learning concepts, tips, and good practices comes from the teachers and pedagogical team. \
